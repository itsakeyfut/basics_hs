# C++ Fundamentals

[![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-learning--repository-blue?style=flat-square)]()

## Overview

This repository is **not a portfolio**.  
It is a **personal learning repository** created to systematically study and organize fundamental Haskell concepts.

I am using this project to deepen my understanding of basic Haskell syntax, functional programming principles, type systems, and standard libraries.

## Purpose

- To learn and practice basic Haskell syntax and core concepts.
- To document my learning journey with clear, minimal examples.
- To have a reference I can revisit when needed in the future.

## Important Notes

- **This repository is not intended to showcase production-level code.**
- **The examples focus on clarity and fundamental understanding over optimization or best practices.**
- Some code may be intentionally repetitive to reinforce key ideas.

## Topics Covered (so far)

- Basic syntax and expressions
- Functions and pattern matching
- Recursion
- Higher-order functions
- Lists and list comprehensions
- Algebraic data types
- Type classes and instances
- `Maybe` and `Either`
- Monads (e.g., `IO`, `Maybe`, `List`)
- `do` notation
- Modules and imports

Feel free to browse the code, but please keep in mind that if reflects an ongoing learning process rather than finalized or production-quality Haskell code.
