# Introduction to Haskell

## What is Haskell?

Haskell is a statically typed, purely functional programming language with strong emphasis on immutability, type safety, and mathematical correctness. Designed in the late 1980s and standardized in the 1990s, Haskell is named after the logician Haskell Curry.

Unlike many imperative languages, Haskell enforces a programming model where functions are **pure** — meaning they have no side effects unless explicitly marked. This design enables powerful reasoning, optimization, and abstraction techniques, making Haskell a favorite among researchers, language designers, and functional programming enthusiasts.

## Key Features

- **Pure Functional Language**: Functions behave like mathematical functions. Given the same input, they always return the same output.
- **Lazy Evaluation**: Expressions are not evaluated until their results are needed, allowing for efficient and modular code.
- **Strong Static Type System**: Haskell’s type inference and expressive types help catch errors at compile time and encourage correct-by-construction code.
- **Immutability by Default**: Data cannot be modified after creation, which leads to safer and more predictable code.
- **Powerful Abstractions**: Features like higher-order functions, type classes, monads, and algebraic data types allow concise and expressive programming.

## Why Learn Haskell as a Rust Developer?

Although Rust is not a functional language, it shares many values with Haskell:

- **Safety**: Rust's borrow checker and Haskell's type system both prioritize safety.
- **Immutability**: Both languages encourage immutable data structures.
- **Explicit Side Effects**: Rust’s ownership model and Haskell’s `IO` monad both make side effects visible and controlled.

By learning Haskell, Rust developers can gain deeper insights into:

- Writing pure functions and minimizing side effects
- Modeling complex problems with algebraic data types
- Thinking in terms of composition rather than mutation
- Designing APIs with strong type guarantees

Haskell is more than just a programming language — it's a way of thinking that promotes correctness, clarity, and elegance. Whether you're exploring advanced type systems, building functional pipelines, or writing safer code in Rust, Haskell provides valuable lessons that extend far beyond its syntax.
