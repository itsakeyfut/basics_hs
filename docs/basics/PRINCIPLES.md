# Why Pure Functions Matter: Learning from Haskell

As part of deepening my understanding of Rust, I started learning Haskell — a purely functional programming language. One of Haskell's defining characteristics is that functions have no side effects unless explicitly declared. This approach brings serveral advantages, which are also highly relevant to writing safer and more reliable Rust code.

# What Does "No Side Effects" Mean?

In Haskell, a _pure function_:

- Always returns the same output for the same input
- Does not modify global state
- Does not perform I/O (printing, file access, etc.) unless explitcitly wrapped in `IO`

This contrasts with many imperative languages, where side effects are common and implicit.

# Benefits of Pure Functions

1. Easier Testing and Debugging

Pure functions are deterministic — their behavior is predictable and consistent. This makes them easy to test and reason about.

2. Safer Concurrency

Without mutable shared state, pure functions can be safely executed in parallel or concurrently without race conditions.

3. Refactoring Without Fear

Because pure functions are self-contained, you can move, rename, or restructure them without worrying about unintended effects elsewhere in the codebase.

4. Fewer Bugs

Pure code has fewer hidden dependencies, leading to fewer unexpected behaviors and more maintainable systems.

5. Optimized Evaluation

Haskell's lazy evaluation model works well with pure functions, enabling optimizations like short-circuiting and infinite data structures.

# What This Means for Rust

Rust is not a purely functional langauge, but it encourages functional patterns and safe heandling of side effects:

- Borrow checker enforces safe access to mutable data
- Ownership system avoids data races
- Closures and iterators support functional composition

By learning from Haskell's approach to purity and side-effect management, we can write **more predictable, safer, and maintainable Rust code.**
